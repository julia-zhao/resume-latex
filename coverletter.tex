\begin{cvletter}

Hello! I'm a driven and enthusiastic third year in the UW Computer Engineering program with various co-op experiences in verification, backend development, and frontend development. I was excited to see an opening for an Game Programmer Co-op, and am confident in my ability to be an asset to Eden Industries with the skills and knowledge I have gained over my previous four co-op terms.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I'm extremely familiar with C/C++ having worked with it not only for the majority of university projects, but also for my first and second co-op experiences. Similarly, I have accumulated a strong understanding of OOP principles (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism) from classes, jobs, and also projects like mock Space Invaders, and am comfortably familiar with applying them to my code.

I'm also a proven quick learner, and I was able to pick up Clojure within a week and a half of working at Synqrinus despite never having touched any functional programming language before.

During my internship with DRW Holdings, I gained hands-on experience with backend development with Python by updating our distributed key-value database via a publish-subscribe messaging pattern. Furthermore, I also introduced service discovery to the project I was working on, fully transitioning our system from manually updating a text file to an automated system.

On top of dabbling in JavaScript during my DRW internship, I gained even more frontend development skills during my interview at Synqrinus. Some examples of features I implemented was a search bar utilizing Regex patterns to grab info and display it in an interactive dropdown bar, and introducing concurrent file editing using WebSockets. 

\lettersection{Why Eden?}
As an avid gamer, I've always wanted to work professionally on a real game that would be shipped out for millions to enjoy. On top of that, I also have a deep interest in art (I'm a hobbyist digital artist! Find me at @chesyrin on Instagram) and would love to have the opportunity to have a chance to collaborate with various other teams involved in the creation of a game. I'm always looking to branch out and learn new skills and knowledge, and I believe that Eden Industries will provide me with the opportunity I seek.

The projects listed on my resume can be found on my github, @julia-zhao. I look forward to hearing back from you!
